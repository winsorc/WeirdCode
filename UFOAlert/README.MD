Start of project to send notifications when new UFO sightings are reported near a users location. As this is one of my first real-time projects, updates may be slow and plans my change. Contributions welcome. 

Initial function will be monitoring for new entries added to The NATIONAL UFO Reporting Center Online Database and alerting user when a new entry is available. 

Ideas for improvement: Options to alert for all new entires, or entries specific to a state. Alerts relevant to users location. GUI, fun sounds, animations, mobile version. Ability to search previous report data by specific criteria. Possible integrations with other data sets or frequently updated resources such as satellite positions, spacecraft launches, weather events etc.
